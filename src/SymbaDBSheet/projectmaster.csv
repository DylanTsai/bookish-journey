0c5d1ded-8013-4a83-840e-0c9a89711015,Scrub Infosec Lead List,"We just got back the final list of booth leads from Infosec Europe. We need to scrub them according to the List Upload rules, like you did last week with the Alacrinet leads.

Any leads that you scrub out should be put into a different tab/sheet (.csv files don''t do multiple tabs so either save it as a .xlsx first or have two separate .csv files)","1. Have one person start from the top of the list and the other person start from the bottom.
2. Review the lead information. You do not need to add anything from Discoverorg.
3. If you find a lead that should be removed, put it in a separate tab/sheet as these will be sent back to the Europe team for review.*

*Direct Quote from our Europe team: 'Do not alter the file. Whatever data you will “scrub/delete” put it aside on a separate tab – the EMEA VP wants to see what we are eliminating.'""""",1,t,f,2019-06-11 19:29:58.010123+00,,15189d5b-f098-48eb-9949-6688ea392f1e,,2a900058-8e8a-4ed9-a933-3c7dd024e281,6/11/2019,6/12/2019,t
