As we discussed, here are the three problem statements:

1. What is the current landscape for performance measurement for short term employees? (Understanding competitors, current market, competitive pricing, etc)

2. What challenges do short term/temporary employees face in the gig economy? (Understanding how to build a software that creates urgency and something that they will need and cannot survive without)

3. What are the main challenges for companies as they scale their short term workforce and how are they currently trying to address these obstacles?

Please let us know which one you would be interested in, preferably by the end of this week. You are not limited by these three- if you would like to explore another challenge then please feel free to do so!

PS: You can contact us at any time! I can be reached at 973.590.9985 and Ahva (cc''d) can be reached at 210.279.0877.

CAЯBON is an impact enterprise taking proven and profitable solutions in education, women’s empowerment, and sustainable resources to rapidly scale them around the world using our innovative “CAЯBON-copy” model. We amplify and accelerate these selected solutions’ impact through “economies-in-a-box” with a combination of our team’s operational expertise, global talent base, access to capital, and influencer network.

Role Overview:
Analysts will focus on supporting CAЯBON’s portfolio expansion and operations:

Research: Evaluate potential markets and how we should enter them. Explore potential complementary solutions for the portfolio.

Document Preparation: May include but are not limited to: creating decks, one-pagers, info-graphics, blogs, storytelling overviews, and financial models alongside our team of industry experts.

Relationship Development: Network with potential organizations and partners that would be valuable to collaborate with as we build out our portfolio as well as people that you want in your personal network to navigate your own career.

Hustle: We’re a new organization and can’t project all of our needs at this point. Our intern team is absolutely critical in our organization’s ability to quickly react to new opportunities and obstacles that arise.

Qualifications/Characteristics:
1.	We want people that have a burning passion to solve the world’s most pressing problems today.
2.	Experience working on projects related to our pillars are nice to have, but not required.
3.	Demonstrated potential to serve as a leader of the next generation of changemakers.
4.	Age doesn’t matter (we work with both high school and college students).
5.	Minimum of 20 hours/week of availability.
6.	This is on a pure volunteer basis, think of this as real-life social impact and networking course that no school will teach you.

As a first step, please complete the CAЯBON On-Boarding Survey found below.

Impact. NOW!
